# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). It supports user registration, allowing users to create, edit, and store their own shortened URLs. Security features include password hashing and cookie encryption. It includes support for mobile devices.

New update: Link analytics - each time a link is clicked, 3 data are tracked
* The total number of times the link is clicked
* The total number of unique visitors to click on a link (only counts when user logged in)
* A unique visitor ID and time stamp for each click
